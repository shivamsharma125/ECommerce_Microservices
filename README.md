# 🛒 E-Commerce Microservices Architecture

Welcome to the **E-Commerce Microservices Project** – a robust, scalable, and modular system built using **Spring Boot** and following modern **microservices principles**. This repository serves as the central entry point for all microservices that make up the project.

Each microservice is maintained in a separate repository and is independently deployable and testable. This architecture enables high scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## 🧹 Microservices Overview

| Service                                                                    | Description                                                                                        | Link                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛍️ [Product Service](https://github.com/your-username/product-service)    | Handles product catalog, search, and caching logic with Redis and advanced filtering capabilities. | [View Repo](https://github.com/shivamsharma125/ProductService)   |
| 👤 [User Service](https://github.com/your-username/user-service)           | Manages user registration, JWT-based and OAuth2 (Google) authentication, and profile updates.      | [View Repo](https://github.com/shivamsharma125/UserService)      |
| 📧 [Email Service](https://github.com/your-username/email-service)         | Listens to Kafka events and sends transactional emails using JavaMail API.                         | [View Repo](https://github.com/shivamsharma125/EmailService)     |
| 💳 [Payment Service](https://github.com/your-username/payment-service)     | Integrates with Razorpay and Stripe to generate dynamic payment links.                             | [View Repo](https://github.com/shivamsharma125/PaymentService)   |
| 🔍 [Service Discovery](https://github.com/your-username/service-discovery) | Eureka-based service registry to enable dynamic discovery between microservices.                   | [View Repo](https://github.com/shivamsharma125/ServiceDiscovery) |
